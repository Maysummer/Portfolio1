          Hello there! I'm a school-taught systems engineer (BSc) and a
          self-taught frontend engineer, driven by a deep passion for
          technology.
          <br />
          <br />I enjoy simplifying complex ideas into user-friendly designs. I
          also find fulfillment in volunteering to positively impact the
          community.
          <br />
          <br />Collaboration is at the core of my approach, and I am eager to join
          forces with like-minded individuals to build not just functional but
          truly impactful and beautiful products.
